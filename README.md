# Random Password Generator

This script allows users to generate a random password based on their desired length. The generated password is a combination of ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.

## How to Use
1. Run the script.
2. You will be prompted to decide if you want to generate a password. Enter 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.
3. If you choose 'y', you will be asked to provide the desired password length.
4. The script will then display a randomly generated password of the specified length.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Features
- Passwords are generated using a combination of ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.
- The script ensures randomness by shuffling characters multiple times.

## Future Improvements
- Option to exclude certain types of characters, e.g., punctuation.
- Option to ensure the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
